Grab a friend and start playing, rules are simple.
1) First, decide who goes first and what color each player will have.
2) Players must alternate turns, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn.
3) On your turn, drop one of your colored discs from the top into any of the seven slots using the buttons.
4) The game ends when there is a 4-in-a-row or a stalemate.
5) The starter of the previous game goes second on the next game (stop & run to play again).

HAVE FUN!
